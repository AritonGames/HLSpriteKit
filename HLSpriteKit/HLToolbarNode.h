/**
 * Sets tool nodes in the toolbar and effects layout according to all object properties.

 * The square node that holds each tool has anchorPoint (0.5, 0.5).
 *
 * Each tool node is expected to have a size selector which reports its desired size.
 * (The size is expected to behave like SKSpriteNode's size property, where the SKNode
 * xScale and yScale are already reflected in the reported size, but the SKNode zRotation
 * is not.)  Depending on other object properties, either the tools will be scaled to fit
 * the toolbar or vice versa.  In particular:
 *
 *   . If automaticWidth and automaticHeight are both YES, the toolbar will set its height
 *     to the maximum tool node height (plus relevant pads and borders) and its width to
 *     the sum of the tool node widths (plus relevant pads and borders).
 *
 *   . If only automaticWidth is YES, and toolbar height is fixed, the toolbar will scale
 *     the tool nodes so that the tallest tool node will fit the toolbar height (plus
 *     relevant pads and borders), and the others will be scaled proportionally.
 *
 *   . If only automaticHeight is YES, and toolbar width is fixed, the toolbar will scale
 *     the tool nodes proportionally to each other so that the sum of tool node widths
 *     will fit the toolbar width (plus relevant pads and borders).
 *
 *   . Otherwise, with both toolbar width and height fixed, the toolbar will scale the
 *     tools proportionally so they fit into both the fixed width and fixed height.
 *
 * @param The array of SKNodes to be set as tools.
 *
 * @param An array of same length as tools containing strings to be used as identifiers
 *        for the tools.  These tags (rather than, for example, indexes in the array)
 *        are used in all other interfaces in this object interacting with particular tools.
 *
 * @param Animation, if any.  See HLToolbarNodeAnimation.
