/**
 * A generic target for UIGestureRecognizers.
 *
 * Use case: A single delegate for a bunch of gesture recognizers creates and maintains
 * the recognizers, but wants to forward the gesture to different targets based on where
 * the gesture starts.  An example might be an SKScene, which has only a single view (and
 * hence only a single set of gesture recognizers), but perhaps many different SKNode
 * components within the scene, like a world, a character, or a toolbar.  Upon receiving
 * the first touch of a particular gesture, the SKScene finds likely HLGestureTarget
 * components and offers them the chance to become targets of that gesture.  See HLScene
 * for a simple implementation.

@protocol HLGestureTarget <NSObject>

/**
 * Adds itself (as target of an action) to the passed gesture recognizer if it is
 * interested in the particular gesture and first-touch location.  Returns true if added;
 * this helps the caller determine if any of its targets care about the gesture.  The
 * target adds itself with a call like this:
 *
 *    [gestureRecognizer addTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];
 *
 * note: The implementation of this method should assume that it is not already added as a
 * target to the gesture recognizer.  (It is typical for the caller to clear all targets
 * from the gesture recognizer before then offering it to be claimed by one or more of its
 * possible targets for the given first touch.)
 *
 * Returns an additional boolean indicating whether the touch location is "inside" the
 * target (regardless of whether the target added itself to the gesture recognizer).  This
 * value is important so that the caller can decide whether or not to offer the gesture
 * and touch to other targets.  A common example is a button target given a pan starting
 * inside the button: The button does not care about pans, and so does not add itself as a
 * target to the gesture, but it returns isInside YES, so the caller knows that the pan
 * should probably not fall through to other targets.  (This could be separated out as a
 * separate method in HLGestureTarget, but the logic is often computationally redundant
 * with the decision to add self as target.)  (Also, as an motivating example: If all
 * targets were SKNodes and the caller could use containsPoint to determine whether a
 * gesture first touch was "inside" a particular target, then the target wouldn't have to
 * weigh in.  But clearly a hit test inside a bounding box is not always sufficient; it
 * depends on the target.)  Typically, all touches passed to a gesture target's
 * addToGesture method can be assumed to be inside the target (because of the caller's
 * logic), unless the touch falls into some space of the target which is considered
 * invisible (from a user's point of view).
 *
 * To explain the logic, here is a sketch of a typical caller implementation.  The caller
 * is a UIGestureRecognizerDelegate of a number of standard gesture recognizers.  It has a
 * number of possible targets for the gestures, some of which are controlled completely by
 * the caller, and some of which are encapsulated into opaque components.  The motivating
 * example is reusable subclasses of SKNode, which can't own their own gesture
 * recognizers, since they aren't UIViews.  On first touch of a gesture recognizer
 * (gestureRecognizer:shouldRecieveTouch:), the caller might use bounding box
 * (e.g. SKNode's containsPoint) or other hit testing (e.g. SKNode's nodeAtPoint) to find
 * possibly-relevant targets, and then query them in order of visible layer height
 * (e.g. SKNode's zPosition): each target is asked to add itself to the gesture if it's
 * interested.  A caller might decide to only offer the gesture to the first target that
 * claims the gesture's first touch is "inside"; or, it might decide to offer the gesture
 * to all targets at a location regardless of layer height and opacity.
