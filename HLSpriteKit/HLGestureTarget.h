/**
 * A generic target for UIGestureRecognizers.
 *
 * Use case: A single delegate for a bunch of gesture recognizers creates and maintains
 * the recognizers, but wants to forward the gesture to different targets based on where
 * the gesture starts.  An example might be an SKScene, which has only a single view (and
 * hence only a single set of gesture recognizers), but perhaps many different SKNode
 * components within the scene, like a world, a character, or a toolbar.  Upon receiving
 * the first touch of a particular gesture, the SKScene finds likely HLGestureTarget
 * components and offers them the chance to become targets of that gesture.  See HLScene
 * for a simple implementation.

 *
 * Use case: Gesture targets return a list of gesture recognizers to which they might
 * add themselves.  It is then the responsibility of the UIGestureRecognizer delegate
 * (usually an SKScene or UIViewController) to add gesture recognizers to the view.
 * But if the delegate already has an equivalent gesture recognizer added, then there's
 * no need to add another.  This method can be used to decide what counts as "equivalent".

 * noob: Might be worth comparing and contrasting with [UIGestureTarget isEqual:].

/**
 * A gesture target implements a property that can get or set the gesture target
 * delegate, which does all the work.  This allows for easy reuse of common delegate
 * implementations; see HLGestureTargetDelegate documentation.
 *
 * Important notes for implementers:
 *
 *   . A particular gesture target might want either a retained or a non-retained delegate,
 *     and the difference is important.  Therefore this "property" needs to be implemented
 *     as a single getter with two setters and two ivars, to make the interface explicit
 *     and harder to misuse.  Sorry, it's annoying.  Here is the recommended implementation:

         @implementation MyClass {
           __weak id <HLGestureTargetDelegate> _gestureTargetDelegateWeak;
           id <HLGestureTargetDelegate> _gestureTargetDelegateStrong;
         }

         - (void)setGestureTargetDelegateWeak:(id<HLGestureTargetDelegate>)delegate
         {
           _gestureTargetDelegateWeak = delegate;
           _gestureTargetDelegateStrong = nil;
         }

         - (void)setGestureTargetDelegateStrong:(id<HLGestureTargetDelegate>)delegate
         {
           _gestureTargetDelegateStrong = delegate;
           _gestureTargetDelegateWeak = nil;
         }

         - (id<HLGestureTargetDelegate>)gestureTargetDelegate
         {
           if (_gestureTargetDelegateWeak) {
             return _gestureTargetDelegateWeak;
           } else {
             return _gestureTargetDelegateStrong;
           }
         }

 *     Motivating examples: If a delegate is a pluggable standalone object
 *     (e.g. HLGestureTargetConfigurableDelegate) then it's convenient to have the
 *     gestureTargetDelegate property retained.  But if the delegate is set to the gesture
 *     target owner or the gesture target itself, then retaining the delegate would easily
 *     lead to retain cycles.
 *
 *   . Since gesture targets are often encoded as part of an SKScene's node hierarchy,
 *     it's important that the HLGestureTarget implements encoding methods to encode
 *     and decode its delegate along with the target.  Example implementation:

         [aCoder encodeObject:_gestureTargetDelegateWeak forKey:@"gestureTargetDelegateWeak"];
         [aCoder encodeObject:_gestureTargetDelegateStrong forKey:@"gestureTargetDelegateStrong"];

         _gestureTargetDelegateWeak = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey:@"gestureTargetDelegateWeak"];
         _gestureTargetDelegateStrong = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey:@"gestureTargetDelegateStrong"];
 *
 *   . NSCopying is not necessarily implemented by gesture targets, but if it is, some
 *     thought should be given as to whether copied targets should share delegates or not.

         copy->_gestureTargetDelegateWeak = _gestureTargetDelegateWeak;
         copy->_gestureTargetDelegateStrong = _gestureTargetDelegateStrong;

/**
 * Adds itself (as target of an action) to the passed gesture recognizer if it is
 * interested in the particular gesture and first-touch location.  Returns true if added;
 * this helps the caller determine if any of its targets care about the gesture.  The
 * target adds itself with a call like this:
 *
 *    [gestureRecognizer addTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];
 *
 * note: The implementation of this method should assume that it is not already added as a
 * target to the gesture recognizer.  (It is typical for the caller to clear all targets
 * from the gesture recognizer before then offering it to be claimed by one or more of its
 * possible targets for the given first touch.)
 *
 * Returns an additional boolean indicating whether the touch location is "inside" the
 * target (regardless of whether the target added itself to the gesture recognizer).  This
 * value is important so that the caller can decide whether or not to offer the gesture
 * and touch to other targets.  A common example is a button target given a pan starting
 * inside the button: The button does not care about pans, and so does not add itself as a
 * target to the gesture, but it returns isInside YES, so the caller knows that the pan
 * should probably not fall through to other targets.  (This could be separated out as a
 * separate method in HLGestureTargetDelegate, but the logic is often computationally redundant
 * with the decision to add self as target.)  (Also, as an motivating example: If all
 * targets were SKNodes and the caller could use containsPoint to determine whether a
 * gesture first touch was "inside" a particular target, then the target wouldn't have to
 * weigh in.  But clearly a hit test inside a bounding box is not always sufficient; it
 * depends on the target.)  Typically, all touches passed to a gesture target's
 * addToGesture method can be assumed to be inside the target (because of the caller's
 * logic), unless the touch falls into some space of the target which is considered
 * invisible (from a user's point of view).
 *
 * To explain the logic, here is a sketch of a typical caller implementation.  The caller
 * is a UIGestureRecognizerDelegate of a number of standard gesture recognizers.  It has a
 * number of possible targets for the gestures, some of which are controlled completely by
 * the caller, and some of which are encapsulated into opaque components.  The motivating
 * example is reusable subclasses of SKNode, which can't own their own gesture
 * recognizers, since they aren't UIViews.  On first touch of a gesture recognizer
 * (gestureRecognizer:shouldRecieveTouch:), the caller might use bounding box
 * (e.g. SKNode's containsPoint) or other hit testing (e.g. SKNode's nodeAtPoint) to find
 * possibly-relevant targets, and then query them in order of visible layer height
 * (e.g. SKNode's zPosition): each target is asked to add itself to the gesture if it's
 * interested.  A caller might decide to only offer the gesture to the first target that
 * claims the gesture's first touch is "inside"; or, it might decide to offer the gesture
 * to all targets at a location regardless of layer height and opacity.
