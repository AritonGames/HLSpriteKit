 *
 *   - modal presentation of a node above the scene
 *
 *   - registration of nodes for common scene-related behaviors (e.g. resizing when the

 *
 * note: Composition would be better than inheritance.  Can functionality be grouped into

/**
 * Registers a node (a descendant in the scene's node tree) for various automatic behavior
 * in the scene; see documentation of HLSceneChild* values, above.
 *
 * In general it is not strictly required that the node be currently part of the scene's
 * node tree, but certain options might assume it.
 *
 * Custom behavior attempts to be extremely low-overhead for non-registered nodes, so that
 * scenes can subclass HLScene and only subscribe to the desired behavior without other
 * impact.  Some memory overhead is to be expected, both for the class and for registered
 * nodes; nodes can be unregistered by unregisterDescendant:.
 *
 * Failure to unregister nodes often has little functional impact, but it will retain
 * references unnecessarily.
 *
 * note: One problem with the current design, for the record: Each node gets registered as
 * a pointer in an NSSet for its feature.  If many nodes are registered, then the memory
 * use will be significant.  That said, the options do not lend themselves to widespread
 * use on lots and lots of nodes in the scene.  One option to keep an eye on is gesture
 * target registration: Probably HLScene's gesture recognition system is not suited to use
 * for lots and lots of targets.
 *
 * note: An alternate design would be to put requests for scene behavior in the nodes
 * themselves (perhaps by having them conform to protocols, or perhaps by having them
 * subclass a HLNode class which can track desired options).  Then, children in the scene
 * don't need to be added specially; they can be discovered during normal adding with
 * addChild:, or else discovered lazily (by scanning the node tree) when needed.  The main
 * drawback seems to be an invisible performance impact (no matter how small) for the HLScene
 * subclass.  With explicit registration, the subclasser can be relatively confident that
 * nothing is going on that wasn't requested.  Also with explicit registration, the caller
 * is able to override node information, for example not registering a child for gesture
 * recognition even though it conforms to HLGestureTarget.
 *
 * note: Okay, one more note: I waffle a bit on gesture targets.  They are easily discovered
 * implicitly (by their conformance to HLGestureTarget); the use case for adding an
 * HLGestureTarget to a scene but not wanting it to receive gestures is small (and could
 * be addressed by registering a node to *not* be a target if needed); and it's somewhat
 * surprising when you add some kind of interactive node to a scene and it doesn't
 * interact.  But, on the other hand: It's really nice having the HLScene manage the
 * shared gesture recognizer objects during registration (by asking the target what
 * recognizers it needs).  So, waffle.

/**
 * Current interface is protected and unsafe.  It will evolve into something safer,
 * and this documentation will certainly be updated.  Certainly.
 *
 * HLScene implements a gesture recognition system that can forward gestures to
 * HLGestureTarget nodes registered the appropriate option (in registerDescendant:).  The
 * system implementation works by magic and does exactly what you want it to without
 * configuration.  If, however, you do not want to partake in the mysteries, do not
 * register any nodes with the gesture target option, and feel free not to call super on
 * any of the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate methods (though they will try not to do anything
 * surprising if called).
 *
 * Notes for subclasses:
 *
 *   - The gesture recognizers are stored in shared protected variables for easy and quick
 *     access.  The rationale for shared: We want as few gesture recognizers on the
 *     scene as possible, and we assume they should almost always be configured the same
 *     way (e.g. a long press should take the same amount of time in all parts of the
 *     interface).  But if direct ivar access proves messy, we can provide accessors
 *     instead.
 *
 *   - The HLScene calls needShared*GestureRecognizer methods to create gesture
 *     recognizers for any gesture recognizers needed by HLGestureTarget nodes registered
 *     with registerDescendant.
 *
 *   - The HLScene implementation of didMoveToView adds any created gesture recognizers
 *     to the view.  The implementation of willMoveFromView removes them.  (Gesture
 *     recognizers created in between will add themselves to the scene's view automatically.)
 *
 *   - Subclasses shall call the gesture recognizer need* methods to create needed gesture
 *     recognizers.  The need* methods are safe to call multiple times, and will only
 *     create the gesture recognizer if it is not already created.
 *
 *   - Subclasses may override gesture recognizer need methods to configure the gesture
 *     recognizers as desired.  (Alternately, subclasses may configure the gesture
 *     recognizers at the time of their choosing by accessing the ivars directly.)  If
 *     overridden, the methods should be sensitive to repeated calls, as documented, and
 *     should also add any newly created gesture recognizers to the scene's view (if it
 *     exists at creation time).

/**
 * HLScene implements gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch: to look for HLGestureTarget
 * nodes which intersect the touch and see if any of them want to handle the gesture.
 * The HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestMode determines the way that the method finds targets:
 * Should it start with the node deepest in the tree, or with the highest zPosition?
 * If not stopping with the first node hit, should it then look for more targets by
 * traversing parents in the node tree, or again by zPosition?  Here are the current
 * options:
 *
 *   HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestModeDeepestThenParent: Uses [SKNode nodeAtPoint] to
 *   find the deepest intersecting node, and then traverses up the node tree looking
 *   for handlers.  Presumably this mode works best with SKScenes where
 *   ignoresSiblingOrder == NO (the default), so that this hit-test finds things in
 *   render order.
 *
 *   HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestModeZPositionThenParent: Uses [SKNode nodesAtPoint] to
 *   find the intersecting node with the highest zPosition, and then traverses up the
 *   node tree looking for handlers.  Presumably this mode works best with SKScenes
 *   where ignoresSiblingOrder == YES, so that this hit-test finds things in render order.
 *
 * noob: Seemingly obvious, but currently unimplemented, would be a mode where intersecting
 * nodes are collected by [nodesAtPoint] and then traversed in order of zPosition (highest
 * to lowest).  HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestModeZPosition, presumably.  But parent-traversal
 * is already coded, and works in simple cases, so I'm delaying implementation until I have
 * a use-case for zPosition-only.
