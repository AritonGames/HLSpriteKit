/**
 * Common gesture handling configurations:
 *
 *   - Set this node as its own gesture target (via SKNode+HLGestureTarget's
 *     hlSetGestureTarget) to get a simple callback for taps via the squareTappedBlock
 *     property.
 *
 *   - Set a custom gesture target to recognize and respond to other gestures.  (Convert
 *     touch locations to this node's coordinate system and call squareAtLocation as
 *     desired.)
 *
 *   - Leave the gesture target unset for no gesture handling.
 *
 * note: The class was originally created with only the squareTappedBlock option, but
 * since then has been extended to allow for arbitrary gesture targets.  Consider
 * deprecating squareTappedBlock (and self- delegation); the owner would use
 * HLTapGestureTarget to get almost-as-convenient functionality.
