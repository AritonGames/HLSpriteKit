@interface HLComponentNode : SKNode <NSCoding, NSCopying>

/**
 * By default, because of SKScene's ignoresSiblingOrder property, scenes use node tree
 * structure to determine rendering order of child nodes.  When ignoresSiblingOrder is set
 * to YES, though there is a potential for difficulty:
 *
 *   . On one hand, a scene must remain in complete control of the zPositions of its
 *     components, so that it can determine render order.  For instance, if two components
 *     A and B are siblings in the scene, the scene might choose to render B above A by
 *     setting A.zPosition to 0.0f and B.zPosition to 1.0f.  Component A must not then
 *     have a child node which has its own zPosition of 10.0f relative to its root node A.
 *
 *   . On the other hand, the child nodes of a component (i.e. a custom subclass of
 *     SKNode), by convention, are considered private, and should only be managed by the
 *     component.
 *
 * The zPositionScale provides a way for the scene to limit the range or scale of
 * zPositions used by any children nodes of the component.  To continue the previous
 * example, the scene might control rendering order like this:
 *
 *     a.zPosition = 0.0f;
 *     a.zPositionScale = 1.0f;
 *
 *     b.zPosition = 1.0f;
 *     b.zPositionScale = 1.0f;
 *
 * Component A will limit itself to the zPositions from [0.0f,1.0f).  The principle
 * continues to apply when components contain components, of course; a menu component
 * containing button components will decide how many layers it needs, divide its own
 * zPositionScale into smaller scales for each layer, and set each owned component with
 * the smaller scale value.
 *
 * It's worth emphasizing: The component shall keep all of its child node zPositions
 * *less* than the largest value in the scale.  For instance, if a component has a scale
 * of 3.0f and it needs three layers, it is conventional that it should calculate for its
 * layers zPositions of 0.0f, 1.0f, and 2.0f (and not use 3.0f or even 2.99999999f).
 *
 * Default value is 1.0f.
