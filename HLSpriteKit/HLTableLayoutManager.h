 * This manager may be attached to an SKNode via the SKNode+HLLayoutManager
 * category, using setLayoutManager.
 *
 * note: The number of layout parameters could be greatly reduced if, for example,
 * the owner was required to specify the positions of columns and rows rather than
 * the widths and heights.  (In that case, then no anchor points would need to
 * be specified.)  The whole idea of this layout class, though, is that this
 * particular parameterization captures a common layout concept.

/**
 * An array of CGFloats specifying the widths of table columns.  Columns in the table
 * without corresponding widths in the array will be sized according to the last
 * column width in the array.
 *
 * Special sizes may be specified as followed:
 *
 *  . A size of 0.0f (that is, a value that has a difference from 0.0f less than
 *    HLTableLayoutNodeEpsilon) means the layout manager should attempt to size
 *    the column to fit the largest node in the column.  This is a little messy:
 *    If a node responds to @selector(size), then that size will be used;
 *    otherwise if the node is a kind of SKLabelNode, then frame.size will be
 *    used; otherwise, the node is considered to have zero size.
 *
 *  . A size less than zero (actually, less than -HLTableLayoutEpsilon) will
 *    expand the column to share the available constrained width of the table.
 *    Furthermore, the extra space can be shared unequally: it will be allocated
 *    according to the ratio of the expanding columns' sizes.  For example, say
 *    the constrained width of the table is 100 for three columns.  If the tableBorder
 *    is 1 and the columnSeparator is 2, that leaves 95 for the columns.  The
 *    first column is specified with a fixed size of 35, leaving 60 for the two
 *    remaining columns, which have sizes specified as -1.0 and -2.0, resulting in
 *    actual column sizes of 20 and 40, respectively.

/**
 * The anchor points used for cell position calculations during layout; this can
 * be used to set vertical and horizontal justification for cells in each column.
 * (Note: The nodes being laid out may or may not have their own anchorPoint
 * properties; if they do, they will be ignored by this layout manager, though
 * in most cases the corresponding column anchor point should be set to the same
 * value.)  Columns in the table without corresponding anchor points in the array
 * will be anchored according to the last anchor point in the array.
 *
 * An example: Say a table layout manager is laying out rows that contain an
 * icon, a line of text, and a few number values.  The icon is a SKSpriteNode with
 * default anchorPoint (0.5, 0.5).  The line of text is an SKLabelNode with
 * left horizontal alignment and baseline vertical alignment; a good anchor point
 * would be (0.0f, 0.25f) to put the label on the left side of the cell and a bit
 * up from the bottom (to leave room for the font descender below the baseline).
 * The number values are also SKLabelNodes with the same baseline alignment, but
 * with right alignment, and so they should go at anchor point (1.0f, 0.25f).  All
 * together, a good setting for columnAnchorPoints would be:
 *
 *         @[ [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(0.5f, 0.5f)],
 *            [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(0.0f, 0.25f)],
 *            [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(1.0f, 0.25f)] ]
